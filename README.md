# ZeppelinOS library

This package provides a library to develop, deploy and operate upgradeable smart contracts on Ethereum and every other EVM and eWASM-powered blockchain.

This library is considered low level. For regular development, we recommend the CLI-aided development experience with the [ZeppelinOS CLI](https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos-cli).

### :warning: This repo is deprecated :warning:

This package has been moved to a monorepo at [zeppelinos/zos](https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos/tree/master/packages/lib#readme). The github repository will remain open to keep the issues up until they are either closed or migrated.
